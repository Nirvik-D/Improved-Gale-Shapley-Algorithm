# Improved-Gale-Shapley-Algorithm

An improved version of the Gale Shapley Algorithm that pairs up elements from two differnt sets and forms stable relationships in a reduced amount of time than the traditional algorithm.Using Probability, the algorithm predicts the most eligible and stable pairing which accelerates the entire process of pairing.<br> 
The two sets used in this program are a set of males and a set of females with each member having his/her own set of choices based on personal choices.
