# Improved-Gale-Shapley-Algorithm

An improved version of the Gale Shapley Algorithm that pairs up elements from two differnt sets and forms stable relationships in a reduced amount of time than the traditional algorithm.<br>
Using Probability, the algorithm predicts the most eligible and stable pairing which accelerates the entire process of pairing.
